      <description>From the profitability report released by the Finance department of xyz shipping company, it was observed that a lot of expenditure is being spent on safety equipments for passengers. The management therefore wants a suitable cost cutting strategy to resolve this crisis and balance the financial sheet. A memo has been sent to the Data analysis department to resolve this problem using Machine Learning. The management needs a user web interface where one can easily predict the survival rate of passengers according to their Age, Sex, and Embarked status.</description>

      <description>Web Scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. For this project I built a web scrapper to scrap indeed.com for information.
Methodology
 Scrape the first 100 available search results Generalize the code to allow searching for different locations/jobs Pick out information about the URL, job title, and job location Save the results to a file    Link to Github Repository</description>

      <title>Project 1: Predicting Credit Card Approvals</title>

      <description>Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual&amp;rsquo;s credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I built build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.</description>

      <description>A Chinese automobile company &amp;ldquo;Geely Auto&amp;rdquo; aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. Inquiry made into understanding the data and its values showed that the data contained considerable amount of continuous data values. Thus requiring the use of Regression statistical model for analysis. Further inquiry made into the dataset showed Price to be the dependent variable.</description>

      <description>In an episode of the television show The Wire, drug dealers assume the police are intercepting their text messages. Whenever a phone number needs to be texted in the course of a criminal conspiracy, the dealers will obfuscate the number. They use an algorithm we’ll call “Phone Encoder” because each number is changed to its mate on the opposite of a US telephone pad if you jump over the 5. In this Project, I wrote a Python program called jump.</description>
